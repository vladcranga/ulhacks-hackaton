# EduHub - An educational E-centre

The project that empowers learning created for the [ULHacks Hackaton](https://ulhacks.com). 

EduHub represents an all-in-one website that has a productivity blog, a link to a chrome extension that helps eliminate distractions, and a forum where the members can learn new things. It is made for students, by students in order to ensure that they achieve their goals.

## The Chrome extension *

The purpose of the extension is to make use of timers in order to create periods during which the user has increased productivity. You can set a timer, and during that time the websites that are considered distractions are blocked.

## The forum

Made using Ruby on Rails, the forum offers the users a way to interact with like-minded inviduals. You can register, make a new post, and comment on other people's posts.
